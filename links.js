/*


I propose hyper-links as natural occurence in the moteplace
    ( simplest example - logical AND/OR, taking 2 inputs and having 1 output)

_LINKS should be saved and used later as templates

Basic types should include "is part of" as a type of link.
What else..

Logic?
Time??

Or should I just do links as nodes? just with special properties..

Hmmmm.....

What is better - special types of nodes or completely different thing?

I'd say that links should be different from nodes.

let _LINKS = [];
let _LINK_TYPES = [
    {
        name:'is part of',
        style:{

        },
    }
];

//



function renderLink(link){
    
}
